# IrwinBot
Irwin, yo! This file has application specific instructions on how to install IrwinBot on your computer

## Instalation
1. First, make sure you have Java 8 installed on your computer. You may download it [here](https://java.com/en/download/)
2. Create a new folder (also called a directory) on your computer and name it whatever you'd like. All the bots files will be there.
3. Download the latest version of `IrwinBot.jar` and `runner.bat` and put it in your irwinbot folder.
4. Click `runner.bat`. Clicking this file will be how you'll run the bot
5. A new file called configuration.properties will have been created. When you open this file in a text editor, it'll look something like this:

```
#Refer to the README file for more information

prefix=\+
token=
```

If you haven't already, you'd need to create a bot account on discord and paste the token into this file. The token is bassically the username/password for the bot, so you shouldn't share it with anyone. 

6. Rerun the bot. A new folder will be created called `irwins` in your irwinbot folder. Copy and paste the irwins you want the bot to access there! Please note that it's reccomended to keep a copy of all irwins in a seperate folder, just in case.

7. Rerun the bot one last time and invite it to your server
